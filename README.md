# Project 2- Model Performance Comparison on Investments
Contributers:  Bria, Anurag, Bryan and Evelyn.

Objective

In this project we wanted to know which machine learning models could best perform in forecasting stock prices and returns. Specifically in Bitcoing and S&P 500 for the past 5 years. 

Data and Clean up

For simplicity, we chose CSV files downloaded from Kaggle and cleaned the data using the data frame funnction

3.Models and techniques used to evaluate performance

We used Prophet, Arima and Neural Network for analysis and forcecasting. Prophet was used, as an effort to to pick up trends and changes over time. Arima, which stands for Autoregression Integrated Moving Average, was used
