# Project 2- Model Performance Comparison on Investments
Contributers:  Bria, Anurag, Bryan and Evelyn.

Objective

In this project we wanted to know which machine learning models could best perform in forecasting stock prices and returns. Specifically in Bitcoin and the S&P 500 for the past 5 years. 

Data and Clean up

For simplicity, CSV files downloaded from Kaggle and Data was cleaned using the data frame function

3.Models and techniques used to evaluate performance

We used Prophet, Arima and Neural Network for analysis and forcecasting. Prophet was used, as an effort to to pick up trends and changes over time. Arima, which stands for Autoregression Integrated Moving Average, uses multiple different variables to analyse a time series. Autoregression makes a comparision between data of the past and present, while the Moving Average shows the comparison between the past and present forecast errors. The most elaborate and complex Machine Learning model we used are Neural Networks, that portarays more complex relationships.
